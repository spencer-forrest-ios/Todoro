# Todoro

This application helps the user to stay focus for certain a duration by using the famous "Pomodoro" technique. 
The user can change the duration of a pomodoro, a short rest, a long rest and the total number of pomodori. 
The app notifies the user at the end of each duration.
A user can skip a rest, reset a duration (current rest or pomodoro) or stop all the pomodori to start over.
